# HP Proliant HW Monitor

The hppro_hwmon Perl script will query the HP Linux hpasmcli and hpacucli command-line tools to check or show the health of your Proliant hardware. It will check following components:

* Fans
* Memory DIMMs
* Power Supplies
* Server
* Temperature Controls
* RAID Controller
* Physical Drives
* Logical Drives

The script will check with a standard set of components but can be easily customized to fit your needs.

Note: The script has been tested on older Proliant G2-G6 generation systems only
